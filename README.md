Decoding Emotions in Text

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to decode emotions hidden in text. By analyzing written content, it classifies text into emotional categories such as joy, sadness, anger, or neutrality, offering insights into human sentiment and behavior.

🔍 Project Overview

Loads and preprocesses text data (tokenization, stopword removal, vectorization).

Trains sentiment analysis models using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.

Explores clustering metrics like Silhouette Coefficient to assess quality.

Evaluates performance with classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

TensorFlow, Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

📊 Key Insights

Machine learning models can detect emotional tones with good accuracy.

Text clustering reveals natural groupings of sentiments.

Feature engineering improves the quality of predictions.

🚀 Results

The project demonstrates how NLP can be used to interpret and categorize emotions, making it valuable for applications like customer feedback, social media monitoring, and mental health analysis.
